# Proof Of Impact

#### Issues and challenges: 

We tried to deploy our NFT contract but we figure there is some issue with SmartPy - as we tested our code and a template from the platform and we were *not* able to deploy. We selected the `GHOSTNET` and funded our wallet with faucet but we still had issues. Please look wallet below:

None the less we made progress in the front-end where we will be able to post our NFTs as Proof of Impact.
